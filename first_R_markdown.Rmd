## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Header Levels
### Smaller Header

Using the hashtag designates a header of a certain size, with one hashtag providing the largest and getting incrementally smaller thereafter.

## Code Chunks

Use three backticks followed by squiggly brackets to include code chunks. Shortcuts are CTRL+ALT+I for windows and CMD+option+I for Macs. Insert near the top will also include code chunks for you. Place lowercase r inside brackets then write desired code on new line.

```{r}
print("Hello World!")
```
## Lists

A single dash followed by the words creates bullet points. square brackets are used to include links.

- bullet point
- **two stars to bold**
- *one star to italicize*
