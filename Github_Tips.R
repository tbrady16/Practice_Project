## Linking to GitHub ##

# in the terminal, change directories to the one of concern " ~/Documents/R? " followed by folder name
# pwd to check current directory
# git init to initialize Git in the directory
# " git add . " and " git commit -m "Initial Commit" "to activate Git repository

# once this is done, create a GitHub repository of the same name as your project
# do not include any readme/initializing documents, instead copy "push existing repository to command line"
# paste provided code into the terminal (from the proper directory)
